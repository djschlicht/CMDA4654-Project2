# CMDA4654-Project2

### Project Guidelines:

   - You are writing a lecture to teach a Statistical/Machine Learning topic to your classmates.
       - You must clearly explain the important concepts related to your topic, a bit of the lighter theory is expected within reason and/or explanation of the algorithm. This is not meant to be an extremely long or thorough lecture, so find a reasonable balance! Don't copy directly from datacamp or other sources (honor code violation).
       - You should motivate when/why we would use a particular method.
       - You should use 1-2 baby examples (iris, mtcars, etc) to demonstrate how the method works.
        In addition to a baby example, you are required to demonstrate your method on data that you must collect yourself from a research area that has been assigned to you in the spreadsheet under Example Area.
   - You are required to use RMarkdown to write your presentation.  You can make slides that are .pdf files or html files.  Slides that are HTML files must be self-contained into a single .html file.
   - The presentation should be a minimum of 27 slides. Yes, you read that correctly.  The first slide should be your title, Group # and member names.  The last slide should be a references slide.
   - You will present your slides in a video with all members of your teammates.  The video should be 20-25 minutes long.  All members of your team must present at least some small portion.  This is not something that can be accomplished at the last minute.  Making slides and a video (plus editing if necessary) take considerable time and effort!!  Note: It's possible to record a lecture using Zoom.
   - In your video, you should be able to get through an explanation of the method and demonstrate your method on a baby example. You should present your method on a larger dataset that you collected yourself from the Example Area assigned to you in the spreadsheet.
   - Your slides should be as professional looking as possible.
       - All R code should be important and immediately useful for teaching the material. We should be able to reproduce your results (some randomness is understandable, but setting a seed minimizes this) by running your code for ourselves.
       - All plots should have elements that are clear and easy to see.  Every plot needs a title and properly labeled axes.  If a legend is appropriate it should be included and easy to see and interpret.
   - You must have some tables and plots.  You are working with data, there has to be some summaries either numeric or visual that are important.
   - You should not dwell on trivial things.  This would be fluff to make your presentation unnecessarily long and doesn't add value.  This includes needless analysis, code, tables, and plots.
       - Example:  Checking the assumptions in regression.  It is well understood that you checked the assumptions that justify the use of linear regression and everything should be okay or else you would not be proceeding.  It's not interesting nor useful to show these kinds of checks.  However, suppose the assumptions were violated and you had to do a transformation, then you can briefly mention that a transformation was done.  If the issues are particularly interesting, you can comment a bit further or show a brief plot or two, but the fact remains that you still haven't demonstrated the new concepts that you are trying to teach.
