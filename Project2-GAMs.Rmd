## Generalized Additive Models

- Type of generalized linear model

- Response variable depends on smooth functions $f_i(x_i)$

- General structure of a GAM:
$$g(\operatorname {E} (Y))=\beta _{0}+f_{1}(x_{1})+f_{2}(x_{2})+\cdots +f_{n}(x_{n})$$

- Smooth functions can be many different things (polynomials, splines, weighted means, etc)

## Summations
A Linear Model sums the linear terms
$$y_i = \beta_0 +\sum_j { \beta_j x_{ji}} +\epsilon_i$$

GAMs sums the  _smooth functions_
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j {s_j(x_{ji})} + \epsilon_i$$
Where $$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2), y_i \sim \text{Normal}$$
<!-- When to use and why-->

## Splines
A _Spline_ is a function made of up basis functions (the smoothing functions)

These simpler functions form a set of functions called the _basis_

When using a spline for GAMs, each basis function has a coefficient

The spline is formed by weighing the basis function coefficients and summing them at each value of $x$

## Wiggliness and Penalized fit
As in the same case with a polynomial regression of excess "wiggles" not constraining the "Wiggliness"
in the way that we penalize the fit in order to prevent overfitting

_W_ or wiggliness is defined by:
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} [f^{\prime\prime}]^2 dx = \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta} = \large{W}$$


## Constraining Wiggliness
We have to make wiggliness important by looking into the log-likelihood,
or the measure of closeness to the data

The term **smoothing operator** $\lambda$ defines the trade-off to find _spline_ coefficients to maximize
the penalized log-likelihood fit

$$ \mathcal{L}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) - \frac{1}{2} \lambda\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta}$$
or
$$\mathcal{L}_p = \log(\text{Likelihood})  - \lambda W$$

## Selecting smooth
There are multiple methods to choose from the right amount of wiggle, some are:
AIC, Mallow $\mathcal{C}_p$, Maximum Likelihood(ML), and Restricted Maximum Likelihood(REML).
The most commonly method is REML for it's numerical stability

There are two ways to optimize the given $\lambda$:

- Predictive: Reducing generalization error
- Bayesian: Using priors for basis coefficients

## Maximizing Wiggliness
In a regular regression, the degree of freedom typically equal the predictors in the model. In the case for GAMs,
we look at the smoothing _basis_ of size $k$ and consider that with **penalized** fitting, their parameters are limited. Thus,
the models _**effective**_ degrees of freedom (EDF) will not equal the size $k$

The models effective degrees of freedom are given by $\displaystyle \text{trace}(F)$ where F is the EDF matrix
$$\displaystyle F=(X^{T}WX+\sum _{j}\lambda _{j}S_{j})^{-1}X^{T}WX$$

## Generalized Additive Models in R
  - Two options for packages, mgcv and gam
  - mgcv is more commonly used and better supported
  
Smooth interactions in R

1. Bivariate smoothing
  - s(x, z, bs = 'tp')
2. Tensor products smoothing
  - te(x, z)

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r}
library(mgcv)
set.seed(0)
sim_data <- gamSim(1, n = 400, dist="normal", scale=2)
head(sim_data)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r}
fit <- gam(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + s(x3), data = sim_data)
summary(fit)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r, fig.height = 4}
plot(fit, pages=1, residuals=TRUE)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4.5}
gam.check(fit)
```

## Example - mtcars
<!-- Wrap pred terms in s() for splines with wigglieness controlled by k argument -->
\tiny
```{r}
data("mtcars")
mtcars_gam <- 
  gam(mpg ~ s(disp), data = mtcars, method = "REML")
summary(mtcars_gam)
```

## Example - mtcars 
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  theme_bw() + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x)) 
```

## Example - mtcars 
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4.5}
gam.check(mtcars_gam)
```

## Example - mtcars
```{r}
```

## Example - Health Data - Explaining Data Set
\tiny
Dataset pulled from the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) which is a a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government.
The Dataset provides state-aggregated data for estimated patient impact and hospital utilization by COVID-19 Patients by a State Timeseries.

https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state

## Example - Health Data - Data Cleaning
\tiny
```{r}
bedOcc <- read.csv("estimated_inpatient.csv", header = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Read dataset
bedOcc <- bedOcc %>% 
          select(state, collection_date, Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated, Total.Inpatient.Beds) %>% 
          drop_na()

# Convert from Character to Numeric and Date variable type
bedOcc$Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated <- as.factor(bedOcc$Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated)
bedOcc$Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated <- as.numeric(bedOcc$Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated)
bedOcc$Total.Inpatient.Beds <- as.factor(bedOcc$Total.Inpatient.Beds)
bedOcc$Total.Inpatient.Beds <- as.numeric(bedOcc$Total.Inpatient.Beds)
bedOcc$collection_date <- as.Date(bedOcc$collection_date)
```


## Example - Health Data - Country Wide 
\tiny
```{r}
# Bed Occupation for COVID-19 patients Country Wide
bedOccCW <- bedOcc %>% 
            filter(state == 'CW')
ggplot(data = bedOccCW, aes(x = collection_date, y = Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) +
  labs(title = 'Bed Occupation by COVID patients in November in the US', x = "Date", y = "Bed Occupation by COVID patient")

```


## Example - Health Data - VA
\tiny
```{r}
bedOccVA <- bedOcc %>% 
            filter(state == 'VA')
p <- ggplot(data = bedOccVA, aes(x = collection_date, y = Inpatient.Beds.Occupied.Estimated)) + theme_bw() + geom_point() +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) + 
  labs(title = 'Bed Occupation by COVID patients in November in Virginia', x = "Date", y = "Bed Occupation by COVID patient")
p
```



## Example - Health Data - LM
\tiny
```{r}
# Linear Model Fit (uses formula = y~x)
p + geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=FALSE, color = 'blue')

# Model Fit adjusting splines
p + geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y~splines::bs(x,3), se=FALSE, color = 'blue')
```



## Example - Health Data - Loess
\tiny
```{r}
# Loess Model Fit 
p + geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) + geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se=FALSE, color = 'blue')
```

## Example - Health Data - GAM
\tiny
```{r}
# GAM Model Fit (formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"))
p + geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) + geom_smooth(method = 'gam', se=FALSE, color = 'red')
```



## Conclusion
- The benefits of implementing GAMs provides a flexible framework to accurately model nonlinear relationships.

- It's formed from basis functions, which weigh regression functions to form larger functions known as smooths

- To control overfitting, we penalize the fit of the model by adjusting the goodness of fit
