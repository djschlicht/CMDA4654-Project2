## Generalized Additive Models

- Type of generalized linear model
- Response variable depends on smooth functions $f_i(x_i)$
- General structure of a GAM:
$g(\operatorname {E} (Y))=\beta _{0}+f_{1}(x_{1})+f_{2}(x_{2})+\cdots +f_{n}(x_{n})$
- Smooth functions can be many different things (polynomials, splines, weighted means, etc)

## Generalized Additive Models
A Linear Model sums the linear terms
$$y_i = \beta_0 +\sum_j { \beta_j x_{ji}} +\epsilon_i$$

GAMs sums the  _smooth functions_
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j {s_j(x_{ji})} + \epsilon_i$$
Where $$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2), y_i \sim \text{Normal}$$
<!-- When to use and why-->

## Splines
A _Spline_ is a function made of up basis functions (the smoothing functions)

These simpler functions form a set of functions called the _basis_

When using a spline for GAMs, each basis function has a coefficient

The spline is formed by weighing the basis function coefficients and summing them at each value of $x$

## Wiggliness and Penalized fit
As in the same case with a polynomial regression of excess "wiggles" not constraining the "Wiggliness"
in the way that we penalize the fit in to prevent overfitting

_W_ or wiggliness is defined by:
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} [f^{\prime\prime}]^2 dx = \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta} = \large{W}$$


## Constraining Wiggliness
We have to make wiggliness important by looking into the log-likelihood,
or the measure of closeness to the data

The term **smoothing operator** $\lambda$ defines the trade-off to find _spline_ coefficients to maximize
the penalized log-likelihood fit

$$ \mathcal{L}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) - \frac{1}{2} \lambda\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta}$$
or
$$\mathcal{L}_p = \log(\text{Likelihood})  - \lambda W$$

## Selecting smooth
There are multiple methods to choose from the right amount of wiggle, some are:
AIC, Mallow $\mathcal{C}_p$, Maximum Likelihood(ML), and Restricted Maximum Likelihood(REML).
The most commonly method is REML for it's numerical stability

There are two ways to optimize the given $\lambda$:

- Predictive: Reducing generalization error
- Bayesian: Using priors for basis coefficients

## Maximizing Wiggliness
## Generalized Additive Models in R
  - Two options for packages, mgcv and gam
  - mgcv is more commonly used and better supported
!['mgcv'](mgcv.png)

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r}
library(mgcv)
set.seed(0)
sim_data <- gamSim(1, n = 400, dist="normal", scale=2)
head(sim_data)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r}
fit <- gam(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + s(x3), data = sim_data)
summary(fit)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r, fig.height = 4}
plot(fit, pages=1, residuals=TRUE)
```

## Example - Simulated Data
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4.5}
gam.check(fit)
```

## Example - mtcars
<!-- Wrap pred terms in s() for splines with wigglieness controlled by k argument -->
\tiny
```{r}
data("mtcars")
mtcars_gam <- 
  gam(mpg ~ s(disp), data = mtcars, method = "REML")
summary(mtcars_gam)
```

## Example - mtcars 
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  theme_bw() + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x)) 
```

## Example - mtcars 
\tiny
```{r, fig.height=4.5}
gam.check(mtcars_gam)
```
## Example - mtcars
```{r}
